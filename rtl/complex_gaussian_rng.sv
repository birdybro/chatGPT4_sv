// In SystemVerilog, designing a synchronous complex Gaussian pseudo-random number generator (CGRNG) module can be achieved using a combination of a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) for generating pseudo-random numbers and the Box-Muller transform for converting uniformly distributed random numbers into Gaussian distributed random numbers. Here's an example of a CGRNG module:

module complex_gaussian_rng (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic reset_n,
    output logic signed [15:0] real_part,
    output logic signed [15:0] imag_part
);

// Internal signals
logic [31:0] lfsr;
logic signed [15:0] z0, z1;
logic gen_z1;
logic [15:0] u1, u2;

// LFSR for generating uniform random numbers
always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge reset_n) begin
    if (!reset_n) begin
        lfsr <= 32'h1;
    end else begin
        lfsr <= {lfsr[30:0], lfsr[31] ^ lfsr[28]};
    end
end

// Box-Muller transform
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    if (gen_z1) begin
        z0 <= z1;
    end else begin
        u1 <= lfsr[15:0];
        u2 <= lfsr[31:16];
        logic signed [31:0] r = $sqrt(-2 * $ln(u1 / 16'h10000)) * 32'h10000;
        logic signed [31:0] theta = 2 * 32'h10000 * 16'h3_1416 * u2 / 16'h10000;

        z0 <= r * $cos(theta);
        z1 <= r * $sin(theta);
    end
end

// Output the generated complex Gaussian numbers
assign real_part = z0;
assign imag_part = z1;

// Control signal for generating z0 or z1
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    gen_z1 <= ~gen_z1;
end

endmodule

// This example module generates 16-bit complex Gaussian random numbers with real and imaginary parts. It uses a 32-bit LFSR for generating uniform random numbers and a Box-Muller transform to convert the uniform random numbers into Gaussian distributed random numbers. The output real and imaginary parts are updated synchronously on each clock edge.

// Note that this is a simple example for illustration purposes. In a real-world design, it's important to consider the quality of the generated random numbers, their distribution, and possible optimizations for improved performance.
